### Note: We put the original Fabflix (8080 port) and the load balancer (80 port) on the same AWS instance. So We have 3 AWS instances and 1 GCP.

- # Connection Pooling
    - #### filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of using JDBC Connection Pooling.
    Project5/src/main/resources/application.properties
    Project5/src/main/java/com/cs122b/project/Fabflix/Service/DBService.java
    
    - #### Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code.  
    Firstly, we configure the connection pooling in spring boot by do the configuration in application.properties, then spring will create a bean for us, and we can inject this DataSource bean and use it to get connection with MySQL.
    
    - #### Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL.
    There are two datasources(Thread pool) in our project, the datasource is binded and connect to the local slave SQL, only for reading data, the writedatasource is connected to the master SQL, and is used to perform write operation. The dbservice request connection from datasources and close that connection after work is done. For the search dbservice, Spring AOP is used for performance monitoring.
    

- # Master/Slave
    - #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL.  
    Project5/src/main/resources/application.properties
    Project5/src/main/java/com/cs122b/project/Fabflix/Service/DBService.java

    - #### How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?
    We configured two datasources in [application.properties](./Project5/src/main/resources/application.properties), one for read, one for write, and we connect the write datasoure with the master slave. When we have to insert or update the database we use the read datasource.

- # JMeter TS/TJ Time Logs
    - #### Instructions of how to use the `log_processing.*` script to process the JMeter logs.
    ```
    pip install jsonlines
    python3 log_processing.py test01.log
    ```

TS is aroud 2.93 while JS is aroud 2.73, we can see that TS>TJ, which satisfied our expectation that TJ is part of TS. Time diffence between AQT and TS is the time spent in the network transmit, which is much larger than TS.           |

https://18.188.106.209:8443/   

Video: https://youtu.be/JqRsP_cgLZA

## Deployment:

Website: cd Project3 && sudo sh deploy.sh

## FrontEnd:

the code for frontend auto-complete:  https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-60/blob/master/FrontendSource/Customer/src/views/Search.vue

**Note: For the frontend, we use Vue.js framework. Since the aws EC2 instance has limited memory and CPU, we can not install vue-cli, which is essencial to build the forntend on the server, therefore we can not demo build on the EC2.  We can only build it locally and deploy the built target to our website resource folder**

## Contribution:
Jingwen Mo:
1. Implement full-text search
2. Implement backend for Autocomplete
3. Implement Android Login and Movie List Page

Chenxi Yang:
1. Implement frontend for Autocomplete
2. Implement Android Search and Single Movie Page

DataImport: ``cd Datainsert/dbinsert && sudo sh run.sh``

## Prepared Statements:
[DBService.java](./Project3/src/main/java/com/cs122b/project/Fabflix/Service/DBService.java)

## Two parsing time optimization strategies:

1. In-memory hashmap: use hashmap to reduce duplication and drop no-matching data(invalied foreign key in stars_in_movies)

2. bulk insert for all table

note: star id is generated using MD5(starname).substring(0,7)+'0'

``sh ./deploy.sh``

## substring Design:

**Index creation:**

```sql
use moviedb;
CREATE INDEX movietitle ON movies (title);
CREATE INDEX moviedirector ON movies (director);
CREATE INDEX starname ON stars (name);
```

**Query:**

```sql
select * from movies where 1=1 AND movies.title LIKE "%t%" AND movies.year = 2003 AND movies.director like "%d%" and id in (select distinct movieId from stars_in_movies inner join stars on stars_in_movies.starId = stars.id where name like '%s%') ORDER BY movies.title asc , (select rating from ratings where ratings.movieId=movies.id) asc LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;
```

note: ``where 1=1`` is designed for the convience of query formatting, make no sense in query.
